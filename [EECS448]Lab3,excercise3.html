			Hi my names Laura Croft and I'm a gamer girl who likes inexpensive meals and just likes being a nerd lolol. I want to find someone who just likes watching movies and I'm not looking for any drama. I'm really into computer science majors because smart is the new sexy!;D My favorite shows are Friends and How I Met Your Mother. As for bands I'm going through an alternative phase so my favorite bands are 98 degrees, Blink 182, Greenday, and Knickleback. Call me if you want to have some fun!
